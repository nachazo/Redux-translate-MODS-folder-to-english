# Redux-translate-MODS-folder-to-english
Script for translate to english MODS folder contents titles of Anomaly REDUX mod.

REDUX is a addon pack for Anomaly, based on EFP 2.2, that brings a comprehesive [large list of popular addons](https://discord.com/channels/931572900488699935/931574457192050738) working together with sense and without headaches. It's a stable, frequently updated and well done pack, very polished and spearhead of STALKER modding, with updates and lastest addons ready to use. Can be played in english language without any problem.

It works with JSGME for being installed that gives the chance to select optional working addons to your taste. But as is russian made, the name of these addons that list JSGME are in russian, that could be a problem for non-russian talkers. That was I try to fix with simple scripting.

### Redux-translate-MODS-folder-to-english.bat
Translate the titles/names from russian to english. Executing it will transform all folder title names to english. Then, use JSGME for install.

### Redux-back-MODS-to-russian.bat
As updates are distributed in zip files to overwrite existing MODS folder contents, you may re-transform to russian, unzip, and then, go back to english (with previous Redux-translate-MODS-folder-to-english.bat). The way to use: the same than previous bat.

## How to download the .bat files
You can use the direct links:

* [Redux-translate-MODS-folder-to-english.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nachazo/Redux-translate-MODS-folder-to-english/main/Redux-translate-MODS-folder-to-english.bat)
* [Redux-back-MODS-to-russian.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nachazo/Redux-translate-MODS-folder-to-english/main/Redux-back-MODS-to-russian.bat)

Then, download with your browser (File -> Save as) and place it in the Anomaly/REDUX root folder. That will mantain the file enconfing and format without problems.

You can also go to the file here in github, and click on "Raw" button (you'll reach same url than the direct links).

## Installing REDUX 1.1

1. Go to REDUX discord server: https://discord.gg/Cn9t32Gm (accept with the "✅" in the initial message for enter in the server).
2. Go to "[основная-сборка](https://discord.com/channels/931572900488699935/931574356340015184)" channel. Here you have main mod contents file link, 1.1 version under "Ссылки на скачивание Redux 1.1" (i.e Google Drive mirror - there will no more messages there).
3. And get the culminative patch (small updates, fixes...). It is in the same channel, down to last link at "Redux 1.1 от 26.01.22" block.
4. Unzip a clear Anomaly 1.5.1 install (download from https://discord.gg/c4RuJNs channel "[download-install](https://discord.com/channels/456765861953536020/777245134852718592)")
5. Unzip REDUX 1.1 on these folder, and the patches (this will not overwrite nothing, just create a "MODS" folder with the contents you will select with JSGME).
6. Download, place on root folder and execute the [Redux-translate-MODS-folder-to-english.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nachazo/Redux-translate-MODS-folder-to-english/main/Redux-translate-MODS-folder-to-english.bat).
7. Open JSGME.exe (delete JSGME.lng if exists, for open in english).

If you're updating and not installing, read what is write in **Redux-back-MODS-to-russian.bat** section.
